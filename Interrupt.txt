To set an interrupt in the Arduino IDE, you use the attachInterrupt() function, which accepts as arguments: the GPIO pin, the name of the function to be executed, and the mode
attachInterrupt(digitalPinToInterrupt(GPIO), function, mode);

digitalPinToInterrupt(GPIO) to set the actual GPIO as an interrupt pin

The second argument of the attachInterrupt() function is the name of the function that will be called every time the interrupt is triggered.

The third argument is the mode. There are 5 different modes:

 LOW: to trigger the interrupt whenever the pin is LOW;
 HIGH: to trigger the interrupt whenever the pin is HIGH;
 CHANGE: to trigger the interrupt whenever the pin changes value â€“ for example from HIGH to LOW or LOW to HIGH;
 FALLING: for when the pin goes from HIGH to LOW;
 RISING: to trigger when the pin goes from LOW to HIGH.
